# BankSwiftBackend

Welcome to BankSwiftBackend, a Django project integrated with React for facilitating money transfers between users.

## Overview

BankSwiftBackend is a web application designed to provide a platform for transferring money between registered users. It utilizes Django, a high-level Python web framework, for the backend server logic and React for the frontend user interface. This project aims to provide a seamless and secure environment for managing financial transactions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, login, and securely authenticate themselves to access the platform.
- **Transfer Money**: Authenticated users can transfer money to other registered users within the platform.
- **Transaction History**: Keep track of all transactions made within the system.
- **Dashboard**: Provides users with an overview of their account balance and recent transactions.
